`Written Response`

In your own words, write a few paragraphs comparing and constrasting these approaches. Which implementation is "best?" 
Feel free to create an main method and test out each, if you feel that helps your understanding.`


`Abstract Approach:`  
The Abstract approach is one that provides an opportunity to combine properties and predefined methods inside 
of the the base class. All derived classes or objects will inherit these methods and properties. While the 
abstract class may not be instantiated itself directly, a child may be instantiated and will therefore have 
access to all of the properties of the base abstract class through that child. (My favorite, by far.)


`Concrete Approach:`  
The Concrete Approach is most basic approach, and while it requires the most work, it provides the most
due to the fact that concrete classes can be instantiated directly. You may define a new variable of the 
same type of the class in question. All of the properties will be accessible by the derived classes, and 
you must create the code for the methods you would like to declare. 

`Interface Approach:`
