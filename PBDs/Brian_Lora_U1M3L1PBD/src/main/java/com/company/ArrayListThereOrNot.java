/*Task:
* Create an ArrayList of Integers, and fill each slot with a different random value from 1-50. Display those values
* on the screen, and then prompt the user for an integer. Search through the ArrayList, and if the item is present,
* say so. If the value is not in the ArrayList, display a single message saying so. Just like the previous assignment,
* if the value is present more than once, you may display the message as many times as necessary.
