/*Task:
 * Create an ArrayList that can hold Integers, and fill each slot with a different random value from 1-50.
 * Display those values on the screen, and then prompt the user for an integer. Search through the ArrayList,
 * and if the item is present, give the slot number where it is located. If the value is not in the ArrayList,
 * display a single message saying so. If the value is present more than once, you may either display the message
 * as many times as necessary, or display a single message giving the last slot number in which it appeared.
