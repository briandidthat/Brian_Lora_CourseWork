/*Task:
 * Create an ArrayList that can hold Integers, and fill each slot with a different random value from 1-50.
 * Display those values on the screen, and then prompt the user for an integer. Search through the ArrayList,
 * and if the item is present, say so. It is not necessary to display anything if the value was not found. If the item
 * is in the ArrayList multiple times, it's okay if the program prints the message more than once.
