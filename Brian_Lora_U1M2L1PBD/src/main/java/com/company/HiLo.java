/*Task:
* Write a program that picks a random number from 1-100. The user keeps guessing as long as their guess is wrong,
* and they've guessed less than 7 times. If their guess is higher than the number, say "Too high." If their guess
* is lower than the number, say "Too low." When they get it right, the game stops. Or, if they hit seven guesses,
* the game stops even if they never got it right.
