/*Task:
 * Write a program that allows a human user to play a single hand of "blackjack" against a dealer.
 * Pick two values from 1-10 for the player. These are the player's "cards".
 * Pick two more values from 1-10 for the dealer. Whoever has the highest total is the winner.
 * There is no betting, no busting, and no hitting. Save that for real blackjack.
