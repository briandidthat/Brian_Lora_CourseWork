/*Task:
* Write a program that starts with three "piles" of 3 counters each. Let the player choose piles and remove
* counters until all the piles are empty.Start by placing counters (coins or toothpicks or something) into 3 piles.
* The player picks a pile, then removes one or more counters from that pile. (It's okay to take the whole pile.)
* The player picks a new pile, then removes one or more counters from that pile.
* (It's okay to pick the same pile as before.) Once all piles are empty, the game stops.
* You do not need to check for errors like a wrong pile name, or if someone tries to take more counters
* from the pile than the pile has.
